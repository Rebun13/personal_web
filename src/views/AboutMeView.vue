          My name is Rub√©n, I am 27 years old and from Spain. I have a Bachelor's degree in
          <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Computer Engineering</span> from Vigo's University
          (Universidade de Vigo). I moved to Ireland to look for better professional opportunities
          after working as <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Software Developer</span> in Spain
          for 2 years. My dream is to work in a small videogame development team, but right now I'm
          open to working in any development team that allows me to learn, grow and live a nice
          experience. For me, the most important assets in a team are a nice social environment and
          transparent communication, so I would love to find a place that matches these attributes.

          I was born in
          <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Pontevedra</span>, a little town in the northwest of
          Spain, rainyand cold in the winter, and sunny and warm in the summer. My parents' house is
          in the country, so during my childhood, I spent most of my free time riding my bike and
          exploring nature. I have always been one of the top students in the class, at least during
          primary and secondary school. However, my proudest memory from that time is my mechanical
          skills: my friends and I loved to build "<span class="text-lime-400 font-bold"
            >carrilanas</span

          After secondary school, I decided to study for the
          <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Mechanical Engineering Degree</span>
          at Vigo University (Universidade de Vigo). Even though I learned a lot about maths and
          physics, after three years I realized that Mechanical Engineering was not for me, so I
          took a year off to decide what to do instead. Finally, I decided to go for
          <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Computer Engineering</span>. However, life is life,
          and I could not apply for it the first time, so instead of taking another year off, I
          entered the
          <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Telecommunications Engineering Degree</span>, and I
          quickly noticed that I liked software development more than I thought. I improved my
          records so much, and the next year I applied for the Computer Engineering Degree. Four
          years later, I got the diploma.

          After that, I started working for CTAG (Automotive Technology Centre of Galicia) as a
          <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Cloud Developer</span>. There I developed two Django
          apps and three Python libraries, while also providing technical support to our clients.
          With almost 2 years of experience in my back, I decided to go for some adventures and
          moved to <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Ireland</span> to look for a new job as
          <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Computer Engineer</span> or
          <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Software Developer</span>. And there is where I am
          now.
