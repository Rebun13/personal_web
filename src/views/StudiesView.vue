          The first time I entered the university, I opted for Mechanical
          Engineering. I was interested in motorsports, so my objective was to
          end up designing race cars. However, in my third year I understood
          that I had not enough motivation, and I left the degree.<br />During
          these three years I learnd a lot about maths and physics, two subjects
          I love.

          After one year thinking about my future, I decided to sign up in
          Telecommunications Engineering. My intention was to find out if I
          really liked programming and IT, and I actually did. <br />During this
          year I learned C, Mathlab and electronics fundamentals, and got honors
          in Statistics, Programming (C) and Physics (Electronics).

          In 2018 I decided to move to other town and started to study Computer

          Forming Languages and Digital Content Creation.
