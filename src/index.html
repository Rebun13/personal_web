                    My name is Rub√©n, I am 27 years old and from Spain. I have a Bachelor's degree in <span

                    from Vigo's University (Universidade de Vigo).

                    I moved to Ireland to look for better professional opportunities after working as <span
                        class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Software Developer</span> in
                    Spain for 2 years.

                    My dream is to work in a small videogame development team, but right now I'm open to working in any
                    development team that allows me to learn, grow and live a nice experience.

                    For me, the most important assets in a team are a nice social environment and transparent
                    communication,
                    so I would love to find a place that matches these attributes.

                        I was born in <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Pontevedra</span>, a little town in the
                        northwest of Spain, rainyand cold in the winter,
                        and sunny and warm in the summer. My parents' house is in the country, so during my childhood, I
                        spent most of my free time riding my bike and exploring nature.
                        I have always been one of the top students in the class, at least during primary and secondary
                        school. However, my proudest memory from that time is my mechanical skills: my friends and I
                        loved to build "<span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">carrilanas</span>" üèéÔ∏è and the best one
                        was built by me.

                        After secondary school, I decided to study for the <span
                            class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Mechanical Engineering Degree</span> at Vigo
                        University (Universidade de Vigo).
                        Even though I learned a lot about maths and physics, after three years I realized that
                        Mechanical Engineering was not for me, so I took a year off to decide what to do instead.
                        Finally, I
                        decided to go for <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Computer Engineering</span>.
                        However, life is life, and I could not apply for it the first time, so instead of taking another
                        year off, I entered the <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Telecommunications Engineering
                            Degree</span>, and I quickly noticed that I liked software
                        development more than I thought.
                        I improved my records so much, and the next year I applied for the Computer Engineering Degree.
                        Four years later, I got the diploma.

                    <p>
                        After that, I started working for CTAG (Automotive Technology Centre of Galicia) as a <span
                            class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Cloud
                            Developer</span>. There I developed two Django apps and three Python libraries, while also
                        providing
                        technical support to our clients.
                        With almost 2 years of experience in my back, I decided to go for some adventures and moved to
                        <span class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Ireland</span> to look for a new job as <span
                        class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Computer Engineer</span>
                        or <span
                        class="text-lime-400 font-bold">Software Developer</span>. And there is where I am now.
